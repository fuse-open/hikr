## basic info
hikr is an example app case to accompany an upcoming end-to-end Fuse app tutorial. This tutorial will cover many of the basics of Fuse, including creating components, routing/navigation, and customizing the look/feel of your app. It will be part of Fuse's [docs](https://www.fusetools.com/docs), and each chapter will be released one-by-one as they're written in the coming weeks. Afterwards, the tutorial will branch off into a series of "tracks", each of which will cover a more technology-specific piece of information (such as adding a specific backend with login, etc). So stay tuned for that!

_Note: there have been some force-pushes on this repo, so if you've cloned it before the series went live, it's probably a good idea to delete it and clone again._
